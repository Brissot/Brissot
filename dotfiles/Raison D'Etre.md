# Why put dot files Here?

It's a bit weird to use the personal repo to put dot files, however this repo is a good candidate for two reasons:

- My dot files are ok being public. It's actually ok that people know my emacs config, because chances are 1/100 they even use emacs, and if they find it helpful I'm glad to have been of help.

- It's easily accessible and easy to remember Brissot/Brissot is quite easy.

Anyways, that is my Raison D'Etre for this folder
